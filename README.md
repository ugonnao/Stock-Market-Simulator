# Stock-Market-Simulator
This C++ program simulates a multi-stock trading platform that processes buy/sell orders and executes trades in real-time. It maintains per-stock order books using priority queues, supports detailed trade analytics, and introduces a fun feature: a time traveler who determines the optimal buy-sell points for maximum profit.
